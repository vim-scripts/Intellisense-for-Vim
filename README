This is intellisense for Java, XML, HTML, C++, JSP, SQL, C#. This new version is incompatible with the previous version(s).
IMPORTANT: Uninstall any previous versions if you have and then install the new version. 

THIS IS FOR WINDOWS ONLY! 

Usage Tips
----------------
1. Pressing '.' (in java) or pressing '<'  in XML/Html brings the list window
2. Pressing <C-Space> brings context sensitive lists (for both java and HTML/XML).
In HTML/XML this brings the list of attributes for the tags, or auto-completes the attributes)
Try C-Space at different points.

While tool tip is shown, you can use mouse to move to next function or use <C-Left> or <C-Right>

<C-S-Space> in java, brings the tooltip for the current function.
